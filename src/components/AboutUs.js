        IITs have earned a distinguished reputation for their exceptional academic standards and their ability to produce not only technically proficient individuals but also well-rounded leaders who excel in various fields, including management and the art of public speaking. A vital component in this pursuit is the Board of Literary Affairs (BOLA), which assumes the responsibility of fostering and promoting literary talent within the IIT Ropar community.
