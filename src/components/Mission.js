Our mission at the Board of Literary Affairs is to foster and cultivate various literary pursuits. We aim to promote the art of effective speaking on diverse platforms, encouraging students to express themselves eloquently. Identifying and promoting discussions on important issues is a key aspect, fostering critical thinking and meaningful dialogue. We celebrate cinema while identifying and nurturing talent within the field. Providing an outlet for literary talent and increasing general awareness through quizzes are integral to our mission. Responsible use of print and online media, along with workshops focused on debating, writing, quizzing, and other literary fields, contribute to the comprehensive development of students in these areas.
